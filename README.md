# PhiAttrs

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/phi_attrs.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/phi_attrs) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apsislabs/phi_attrs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apsislabs/phi_attrs)

According to [HIPAA Security Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html) ยง 164.312(b):

> Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information.

The `phi_attrs` gem is intended to assist with implementing logging to comply with the access log requirements of ยง 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D):

> Information system activity review (Required). Implement procedures to regularly review records of information system activity, such as audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking reports.

To do so, `phi_attrs` extends `ActiveRecord` models by adding automated logging and explicit access control methods. The access control mechanism creates a separate `phi_access_log`.

**Please Note:** while `phi_attrs` helps facilitate access logging, it still requires due diligence by developers, both in ensuring that models and attributes which store PHI are flagged with `phi_model` and that calls to `allow_phi!` properly attribute both a _unique_ identifier and an explicit reason for PHI access.

**Please Note:** there are other aspects of building a HIPAA secure application which are not addressed by `phi_attrs`, and as such _use of `phi_attrs` on its own does not ensure HIPAA Compliance_. For further reading on how to ensure your application meets the HIPAA security standards, review the [HHS Security Series Technical Safeguards](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/securityrule/techsafeguards.pdf) and [Summary of the HIPAA Security Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html), in addition to consulting your compliance and legal counsel.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'phi_attrs'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install phi_attrs

## Usage

```ruby
class PatientInfo < ActiveRecord::Base
  phi_model

  exclude_from_phi :last_name
  include_in_phi :birthday

  def birthday
    Time.current
  end
end
```

Access is granted on a model level:

```ruby
info = new PatientInfo
info.allow_phi!("allowed_user@example.com", "Customer Service")
```

or a class:

```ruby
PatientInfo.allow_phi!("allowed_user@example.com", "Customer Service")
```

### Extending PHI Access

Sometimes you'll have a single mental model that is composed of several `ActiveRecord` models joined by association. In this case, instead of calling `allow_phi!` on all joined models, we expose a shorthand of extending PHI access to related models.

```ruby
class PatientInfo < ActiveRecord::Base
  phi_model
end

class Patient < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :patient_info

  phi_model

  extend_phi_access :patient_info
end

patient = Patient.new
patient.allow_phi!('user@example.com', 'reason')
patient.patient_info.first_name
```

**NOTE:** This is not intended to be used on all relationships! Only those where you intend to grant implicit access based on access to another model. In this use case, we assume that allowed access to `Patient` implies allowed access to `PatientInfo`, and therefore does not require an additional `allow_phi!` check.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Docker

-   `docker-compose up`
-   `bin/ssh_to_container`

## Testing

    $ bundle exec appraisal rspec spec/phi_attrs_spec.rb
